# What is a client secret?

A client secret is a unique key that is used to authenticate a payment intent. It is generated by the Stripe API and is used to confirm that the payment intent is valid.

Take note that this is different from the publishable key, which is used to authenticate the client-side of the payment process.

To get the client secret, you can create a payment intent using the Stripe API and retrieve the client secret from the response.

Here's a complete documentation about payment intent and client secret: [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret)
