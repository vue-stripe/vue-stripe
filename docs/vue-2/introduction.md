# Vue 2 Support

The latest version v5+ is targeted for Vue 3. If you are using Vue 2, you can still use the older version of the library. The Vue 2 version of the library is still maintained and supported but it will receive lower priority for new features and bug fixes.

This section of the documentation will be updated accordingly during the transition to Vue 3. Some of these updates include link changes, branch changes, etc.
